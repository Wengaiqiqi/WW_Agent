"""Mode-gated tool exposure on the tool-agent ReAct surface.

Plan-A security fix: when the orchestrator delegates ``tool.task`` to
tool-agent, the recently-added authz_grant carries the user's permission
mode. ``tools_for_mode`` / ``make_langchain_tools(mode=...)`` filter the
LangChain tool set so a read-only delegation literally cannot bind
``write_file`` / ``run_command`` to the model.

These tests pin that surface — without them, the previous bypass
(read-only mode + ReAct loop with full tool set) could quietly regress.
