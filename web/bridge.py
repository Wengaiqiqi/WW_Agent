    Why this is load-bearing: ``mcp_host._build_agent_env`` passes
    ``LANGCHAIN_AGENT_MODEL`` / ``_API_KEY`` / ``_BASE_URL`` / ``_PROTOCOL``
    through from the web SERVER's os.environ, and ``turn_env`` only overrides
    them when non-empty. A web turn that relied on settings.json (empty
    per-request model/key) therefore let the tool-agent subprocess INHERIT
    whatever stale values the launching shell had — observed as a leftover
    ``openai`` / api-key ``"x"`` that 401'd, while the in-process planner
    correctly used settings.json (deepseek). Pinning the planner's own resolved
    cfg makes the specialist use the SAME provider+key as the planner and
    overrides any ambient leak. The api_key is resolved from cfg / env /
    credentials; left unset only when none is discoverable (so the specialist
    falls back to its own credential hydration rather than receiving ``""``)."""
