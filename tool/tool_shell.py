# before handing the environment to a tool-agent shell/python child, so a
# prompt-injected `set | findstr KEY` (Windows) or `env | grep -i key` (POSIX)
# returns nothing useful even when the agent's own process has the credentials
# in env (it needs them for its own LLM API calls).
#
# The single broad pattern matches any name containing one of the sensitive
# keywords as a token-boundary-delimited word — covers OPENAI_API_KEY,
# AUTHZ_HMAC_KEY, MY_TOKEN, FOO_PASSWORD, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, etc. The narrower
# provider-name pattern catches per-provider conventions like XIAOMI_AK that
# don't include a sensitive keyword in the name.
#
# Known false positives are rare but possible: any env var whose name
# happens to start or end with ``_API_`` / ``_KEY_`` / etc. (e.g. an
# ``ANALYTICS_API_HOST`` URL) gets stripped. Skill authors that legitimately
# need such a variable should declare it in ``_meta.json`` under ``requiresEnv``
# — the allowlist below honors that and the filter then lets it through.

    ``set`` or ``env``.

    Anything starting with ``LANGCHAIN_AGENT_`` is treated as secret unless it
    appears in ``_LANGCHAIN_ALLOWLIST`` — these few config knobs are explicitly
    safe to propagate. AUTHZ_HMAC_KEY (the orchestrator → agent grant signing
    key) is one of the most important things to strip, and ``HMAC`` /
    ``KEY`` in the keyword set catches it.

    **Skill opt-in**: each skill's ``_meta.json`` can declare a
    ``requiresEnv`` list (e.g. ``["BAIDU_EC_SEARCH_TOKEN"]``). Those names
    bypass the keyword/prefix filters so the skill's bundled scripts actually
